hi guys today i am sick at home because of the recent show at spit. sigh
<br><br>
in my free time i decided to take it upon myself to try one kind of the loose-leaf teas that sarina gave me for my birthday:

which looks SO pretty! and at the same time try to make caramelised tea for the first time. i have seen people online doing this before and thought it looked pleasant.
<br>
i cut up 2 small oranges, so that there were no white parts intact (i heard that this can make the tea bitter).

in a small saucepan i roasted the tea and some sugar, until i could smell it caramelising. then i added the oranges to the pan for maybe 30 seconds? and added boiling water. i don't think i let it steep for long enough? i'm not sure...

the caramelised tea looked very pretty and smelt nice but it was slightly underwhelming :( i think i will stick to normal brewing in the future because this tea itself is very nice. thanks sarina!
