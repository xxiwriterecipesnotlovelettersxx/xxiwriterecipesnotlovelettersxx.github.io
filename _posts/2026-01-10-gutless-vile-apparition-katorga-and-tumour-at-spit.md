Early Saturday evening, a crowd started to gather outside Spit in Footscray for an extreme metal DIY show, played by four local Naarm bands. After leaving Sharetea with a strawberry fruit tea with lychee and strawberry pearls (thanks for the recommendation Holly<3), I headed to the door to buy my ticket. Being more familiar with the local skramz scene, the poster's promise of 'death metal' definitely caught my attention.

With doors at this show opening 7:00, the venue reached its capacity of around 100 people very quickly. The night opened with Tumour, who plunged the audience into the deep end immediately with their extreme death metal sound. They kept the energy high as a mosh pit broke out early into their set. 
<br><br>
Slowing things down as they approached the end, they promised the audience two more songs. The first of these was droning, slow-tempoed, and heavy, with clear doom influence, that let the crowd momentarily catch their breath. However, their brief respite didn’t last long as they closed with a final song that was faster and far more violent, ending their set on a brutal peak.

After a break between bands, it was time for Chigaki Death Metro, an emoviolence band from Adelaide/Kaurna, to play. Their set was much anticipated thanks to their newest release, <a href="https://chigakideathmetro.bandcamp.com/album/10-songs">10 Songs</a>, coming out just the day before. Their live performance reflected the record's sassy and violent sound, which many compared to The Great Redneck Hope.

Late into their set, Chigaki Death Metro promised a cover of Orchid's 'New Jersey vs. Valhalla', with the vocalist adding, "I expect to see you moving". The crowd didn't disappoint as the room descended into chaos.

Goblinviolence took over the stage next, returning to Spit from Eora/Sydney to deliver their unique blend of sasscore and mathgrind once again. Living up to their name, their set could only be described as chaotic. Dissonant guitars and uncountable tempos, combined with high-pitched screams, encouraged perhaps the most unpredicatable and violent mosh of the night.
<br><br>
Regretfully, I missed the later section of their set escorting some friends to the station safely. I can only await Goblinviolence's return to play in Naarm again...

Naarm/Melbourne band all that's left of you played the final set of the night, their last performance before they "hit da studio" (huge). Guitarist Valentine's amp was screamingly loud, bringing a passionate and energetic close to the show. Rumours of a gatecrash cover were confirmed later in their set, as they brought 'flood', the title track from our first release, back to life. This was an emotional moment for some as they sung along.
<br><br>
Their raw and emotional screamo inspired some stage diving among the audience, and even saw Paddy from Wrench crowdsurfing. It was the perfect end to a late show, and everyone left Spit elatedly. Goblinviolence, seemingly not ready to say goodbye to Footscray, were seen walking through the area three separate times over the next hour and a half following the show's end.
