A DIY show inside a south-east Melbourne storm drain is the new best way to spend Valentine's Day with someone you love. Despite many delays, and all the difficulty you can imagine setting up live music in this environment would bring, this amazing show organised by @m0shparty.diy turned out to be a great afternoon full of socialising and skramz music.
<br>
<br>
To be completely honest I got wayyyy too high at this show, and my recollection of events is not wonderful... I also had to leave halfway through in order to make it home on time :( I will do the best I can to show everything I missed!

Goblinviolence took over the stage next, returning to Spit from Eora/Sydney to deliver their unique blend of sasscore and mathgrind once again. Living up to their name, their set could only be described as chaotic. Dissonant guitars and uncountable tempos, combined with high-pitched screams, encouraged perhaps the most unpredicatable and violent mosh of the night.
<br><br>
Regretfully, I missed the later section of their set escorting some friends to the station safely. I can only await Goblinviolence's return to play in Naarm again...

Naarm/Melbourne band all that's left of you played the final set of the night, their last performance before they "hit da studio" (huge). Guitarist Valentine's amp was screamingly loud, bringing a passionate and energetic close to the show. Rumours of a gatecrash cover were confirmed later in their set, as they brought 'flood', the title track from our first release, back to life. This was an emotional moment for some as they sung along.
<br><br>
Their raw and emotional screamo inspired some stage diving among the audience, and even saw Paddy from Wrench crowdsurfing. It was the perfect end to a late show, and everyone left Spit elatedly. Goblinviolence, seemingly not ready to say goodbye to Footscray, were seen walking through the area three separate times over the next hour and a half following the show's end.
