hi ho ho ho! god take my poetry notes app off me now
<br><br>
eacj of us. not two i love but a multitude - each of us a complete hand, hand of my mother! please never die and if you do I will dig inside. and Frankenstein that shit
<br><br>
electricity coils and all, body parts rearranged until you work again and are mine. ours. seeing you go far i pray i can stay here even if maybe we think it's safer to wait inside 
<br><br>
but you don't! you wait for nobody locust - crops will fall if we forget to bless them. bleed thenm dry but still i love everything about you. seed now, maybe an oak later or perhaps a kelp forest yes salmon again.
<br><br>
don't make me dive in there!: if you are there, care for me and bless this newborn. strap him to the board! rejuvenation! i know it can happen . i've seen it before and it was bloody.
