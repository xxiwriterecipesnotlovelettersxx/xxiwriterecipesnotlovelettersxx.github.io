INtroduction about the nighthawks show.

Without much time free between our soundcheck and doors (8:30), I went with Charli, Holly, and Zi & her mum to eat something before the show. We found a Vietnamese restaurant on Smith Street and ate dinner there, but we missed some of Wrench's set in doing so :(
<br><br>
From the closing few songs that I did see, however, Wrench proved their consistency. With the same force they brought to Paddy's house show last October, their coarse, gritty riffs and emotional vocals were met with high energy from the crowd. Their on-stage performance was entertaining, and filled with moments of unexpected heaviness. Wrench have a violent and despairing sound, and I really recommend seeing them live (there is this cool thing that Paddy does with his pedals - don't even know how to describe it).

Following at 9:15 were Naarm shoegaze revival band Ethereal Gone Kids. Their modern incorporation of post-punk elements contributed to the dreamy, flowing soundscape of their set. Drenched in delay and reverse reverb, EGK's guitars ranged from bright, shimmery, and swirling, to deep, coarse, and muddy. Their songwriting was a love letter to classic shoegaze, a surreal and hypnotic 'wall of sound' led by clean and occasionally layered vocals.
<br>
<br>
EGK showed variety in their performance, ranging from introspective & nostalgic to angsty at times. Approaching the end of their set, they continued a recent trend of Silverchair covers in up-and-coming alternative rock band's live sets.

Headlining the night, it was time for me to play my first ever show as a member of Could be Stars. I was nervous to be on stage but settled in quickly. We played some songs from the usual setlist, but also added covers of two songs (flood & nothing to show) from Asher's and my old screamo band, gatecrash. While playing flood, I looked out into the audience and saw Liam from Chromatin at eye-level with me, crowdsurfing. Paddy from Wrench was quick to follow suit.
<br>
<br>
We also made the last-minute decision to debut Floodlight, a song from our new project In Her Palms. This was fun to play (but clearly not well rehearsed yet). For Could be Stars' mostly calm sound, the crowd were very energetic - rivalling Chromatin's set with the amount of moshing at times. As we played our final song, Snow, I saw Liam go upside down in the crowd, before crashing down on my power supply and cutting my guitar signal.

Over the road from Spit, the 10:30 coach that my friends and I were trying to catch did not arrive at  10:30, or 11:00... A comforting voice over a loudspeaker told everyone waiting for a coach to "stand by and see what happens", later telling us that a replacement coach would come shortly after, "fingers crossed". Very reassuring.
<br>
<br>
Approaching 12:00, an empty coach finally arrived and took us home, bringing us back by 2:00 <333
