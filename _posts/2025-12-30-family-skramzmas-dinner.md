<p class="show-intro">
last night 6 of my friends (jesse, sienna, asher, laura, jasmine, kal) and i met at jesse's house for our lovely vegan family christmas dinner. it was very nice to see everyone and spend time together before the end of the year, as well as share food and music.

<p class="show-intro">
here is how YOU can host your very own skramzmas dinner!
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
to cater for the night, i prepared a main course of <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/27/skramzmas-stuffed-pumpkin-roast.html">roasted butternut pumpkin</a>, which was filled with stuffing made from mushrooms, lentils, cranberries, nutmeg, and more.

<p class="show-intro">
for dessert, i tried my hand at making a <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/30/tiramisu.html">vegan tiramisu</a>. although i slightly misjudged the size of container i would need, it exceeded my expectations a lot! i will definitely make this again in the future.

<p class="show-intro">
and, to fulfill a promise made at the last spit show, i also brought everyone some of my <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/11/25/vegan-cookies-that-i-brought-to-spit.html">cookies</a>. these were popular last time, and this batch that i made for the skramzmas dinner might have been the best i have baked so far?? if i do say so myself

<p class="show-intro">
in the afternoon we sat outside while the pumpkin cooked in the oven, making the most of the sunlight before we ate. while everyone sat near or swam in jesse's pool, sienna, kal and i tasked ourselves with moving the christmas tree onto the dinner table (which was MUCH easier said than done). after a few minor setbacks, we took to finalising the decorations and adding some finishing touches to the space.

<p class="show-intro">
we were busily lighting candles, setting the table, and ensuring all of the food was ready to serve. sienna arranged some vegan cheese & sriracha in the shape of some snowmen, with peppercorn eyes. we also made a last minute tropical punch, made of tropical juice, ginger beer, and sprite, filled with pieces of mango and one strawberry.

with all of our decorating completed, the results spoke for themselves...

<p class="show-intro">
to complete the room's ambience, we played some quiet music, closed the curtains and dimmed the lights, and finally invited everyone upstairs to eat. 
</p>

<p class="show-intro">
after we finished our skramzmas dinner, we headed into the kitchen to decorate gingerbread that jasmine had baked and brought in, complete with a turmeric and mango frosting that asher gladly contributed.
