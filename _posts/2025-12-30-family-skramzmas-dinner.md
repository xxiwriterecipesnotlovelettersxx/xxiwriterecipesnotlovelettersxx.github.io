<p class="show-intro">
hi blog viewers!!
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
last night 6 of my friends (jesse, sienna, asher, laura, jasmine, kal) & i met at jesse's house for our lovely vegan family christmas dinner. it was so good to see everyone and spend time together before the end of the year, as well as share food and music
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
here is how YOU can host your very own skramzmas dinner!
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
to cater for the night, i cooked a main course of <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/27/skramzmas-stuffed-pumpkin-roast.html">roasted butternut pumpkin</a>, which was filled with stuffing made from mushrooms, lentils, cranberries, nutmeg, and more.

<p class="show-intro">
for dessert, i tried my hand at making a <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/30/tiramisu.html">vegan tiramisu</a>. although i misjudged the size of container a little bit, i was surprised by how well this turned out! i will definitely make this again in the future.

and, to keep a promise i made at the last spit show, i also brought everyone some of my <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/11/25/vegan-cookies-that-i-brought-to-spit.html">cookies</a>. this batch that i made might have been the best i have baked so far...

in the afternoon we sat outside while the pumpkin cooked in the oven, making the most of the daylight before we ate. while everyone sat near or swam in jesse's pool, sienna, kal and i tasked ourselves with moving the christmas tree onto the dinner table (which was MUCH easier said than done). after a few minor setbacks, we took to finalising the decorations and adding some finishing touches to the space.

<p class="show-intro">
we were busily lighting candles, setting the table, and ensuring all of the food was ready to serve. sienna arranged some vegan cheese & sriracha in the shape of some snowmen, with peppercorn eyes. we also made a last minute punch, made from tropical juice, ginger beer, and sprite, and filled with pieces of mango and a strawberry.

with all of our decorating completed, the results spoke for themselves...

<p class="show-intro">
to complete the room's ambience, we played some quiet music, closed the curtains and dimmed the lights, and finally invited everyone upstairs to eat.

<p class="show-intro">
after we finished our skramzmas dinner, we headed into the kitchen to decorate gingerbread that jasmine had baked and brought with her, complete with a turmeric and mango frosting that asher happily contributed.

<p class="show-intro">
once the sun had truly set, we spent more time listening to and playing music, swimming in the pool, or inspecting wasp nests in jesse's board game collection. though the evening would eventually end up as early morning, our skramzmas dinner didn't feel rushed or overplanned at all. yay!
