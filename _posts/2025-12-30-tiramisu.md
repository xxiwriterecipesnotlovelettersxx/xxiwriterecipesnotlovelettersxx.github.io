i recommend making the saviordi in advance, as these will keep in a container for at least a week and are definitely the hardest part of this recipe.

### Instructions
1. to make the saviordi, preheat the oven to 150°C (fan force), and line two trays w/ baking paper.
2. in a medium bowl, sift together plain flour, cornflower, sea salt, and baking powder. mix & set aside.
3. in a large bowl, pour aquafaba and whip using a stick blender with a whisk attachment, until stiff peaks form. stop mixing & add caster sugar, then whisk again until mixture is glossy.
4. one after the other and whisking in between, pour in the vanilla extract and veg oil.
5. once mixed, fold in the flour mixture until just combined, with no lumps remaining. leave to rest for 10 minutes.
6. transfer the mixture to a piping bag & pipe the mixture into thick lines, around 6-8cm long, on the baking trays. the mixture will be very thick yes this step is HELL.
7. before baking, dust the piped batter with the icing suagar.
8. place in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes.
9. remove from oven to cool, transferring biscuits to a wire rack after 5 minutes. once completely set and cooled, these are suitable to use in the tiramisu.
10. to make the tiramisu, combine espresso, alcohol, and caster sugar in a wide bowl. whisk together until no sugar granules remain.
11. dunk each saviordi finger in this mixture one by one, making sure to flip to ensure that both sides have absorbed liquid.
12. place in a row on the bottom of a deep container, ~21x15cm (the tray i used, pictured below, was too wide). once you have a row covering the base of the dish, pause the dunking and make the cream layer.
13. make the cream layer by placing the melted butter, silken tofu, vegan yoghurt, caster sugar, and vanilla extract in a blender. blend at a high speed until smooth and combined.
14. pour half of the cream from the blender over the bottom row of soaked saviordi in the dish. shake gently to even out the layer.
15. continue soaking and arranging the remaining saviordi in a second layer on top of the first, then pour the remaining cream over the top.
16. seal the container (or cover) and place in the fridge overnight, or a minimum of 4 hours.
17. once ready to serve, dust the top of the tiramisu with the cocoa powder through a sieve, then finish with a finely grated layer of the dark chocolate.

> serve it forth <3
