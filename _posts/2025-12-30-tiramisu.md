- 6tbsp caster sugar
- 170g vegan butter, melted
- 350g silken tofu at room temp

i recommend making the saviordi in advance, as these will keep in a container for at least a week and are definitely the hardest part of this recipe.

### Instructions
1. to make the saviordi, preheat the oven to 150°C (fan force), and line two trays w/ baking paper.
2. in a medium bowl, sift together plain flour, cornflower, sea salt, and baking powder. mix & set aside.
3. in a large bowl, pour aquafaba and whip using a stick blender with a whisk attachment, until stiff peaks form. stop mixing & add caster sugar, then whisk again until mixture is glossy.
4. one after the other and whisking in between, pour in the vanilla extract and veg oil.
5. once mixed, fold in the flour mixture until just combined, with no lumps remaining. leave to rest for 10 minutes.
6. transfer the mixture to a piping bag & pipe the mixture into thick lines, around 6-8cm long, on the baking trays. the mixture will be very thick yes this step is HELL.
7. before baking, dust the piped batter with the icing suagar.
8. place in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes.
9. remove from oven to cool, transferring biscuits to a wire rack after 5 minutes.

> serve it forth <3
