school finally finished today and year 11 is over!
this came right in time i am soooooo tired of going to classes.
<br><br>
i don't think I've fully registered that the holidays have started yet but this is very exciting? mostly i just feel tired. very very very sleepy
<br><br>
i got home and lay down for a few minutes. shoes still on & in my school uniform (also think my bag is still on my bed actually). after shutting my eyes for what was meant to be a few minutes, I slept for 2 hours. i woke up panicking thinking it was the next morning (and that I was very very late for school)..
<br>
I feel soooooo not very nice right now
<br><br>
but! after the confusion and the exhaustion fades i think I will start to feel excited. because now it’s the summer holidays and I have so so much time on my hands. i’m really looking forward doing to things again?? especially band anything - writing, rehearsing, playing shows possibly, and seeing all of my lovely friends who I feel like I haven't seen in a long while. i miss you guys! i'm going to try very hard to make the most of my time these holidays.
<br><br>
so yes;! year 11 is over. i’m exhausted and disoriented, but also looking forward to what lies ahead :o
<br><br>
oh but also holiday homework fuck.
