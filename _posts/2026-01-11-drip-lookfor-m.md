drip! drip! drop! drip!
<br>
<br>
sitting upright
<br>
<br>
demands to put him to death you're killing me?????? stop
<br>
worst poem to date did you know it's about 
<br>
<br>
<br>
look around (In Side) your red-eyed nest. find a Bottle of any colour and break it against the pavement but ... could it be the last time????? i hope so pleaseeeee let me stay afloat
<br>
i wonder if I were to stop altogether. right now and adopt the method that they teach (enforce) : would my thoughts still manifest as clouds or would that be a more water - droplet type thing.?
