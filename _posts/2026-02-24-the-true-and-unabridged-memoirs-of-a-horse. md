another. another falls beside me as i pace. have i considered my existence before yes i have. i know. i know they would not like me to my oh my. these equine powers i possess far outshine any man. any woman. i truly believe that horses will find a heaven of their own,- a place of freedom where they can find shelter in after their life on earth has concluded and their souls no longer have a body to inhabit, even long after their bodies have returned to the ground and been formed again - a horse's soul knows no such human limits don't worry. there is no need for you concern, no need for your intervention: this life is a transitory phase we were not intended to occupy ,-- a factor undermining the true potential that we might possess as a fine breed of HORSES.
