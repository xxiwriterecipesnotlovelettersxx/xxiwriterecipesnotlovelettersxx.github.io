to complete the room's ambience, we played some quiet music, closed the curtains and dimmed the lights, and finally invited everyone upstairs to eat.

once the sun had set, we spent more time playing music, swimming in the pool, and looking at wasp nests in jesse's board game collection. although the evening would eventually end up as early morning, our skramzmas dinner didn't ever feel rushed or overplanned. yay!
