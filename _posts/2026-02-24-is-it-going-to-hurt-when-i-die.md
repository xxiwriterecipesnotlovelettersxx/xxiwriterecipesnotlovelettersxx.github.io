<br>
will it hurt me when i die? will i feel anything at all
<br>
and: if i don't. is that an issue
<br><br>
i don't very much want to leave but i know one day i will have to... venture outside see what us going on. look at the weather out here
<br><br>
becuse they can't lie! they can't lie to me and i heard the rain falling lightly against the roof 
<br>
<br>
the roof i spent hours - my whole life - dtaring at; the memoir of a horse.
<br>
<br>
<br>
will its soft insulation break your fall?
