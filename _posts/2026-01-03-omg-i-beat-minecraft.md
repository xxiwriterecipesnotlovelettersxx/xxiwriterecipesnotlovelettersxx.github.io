<p class="show-intro">
hi guys. i've been getting back into minecraft lately.. we will se how long this lasts. here is what i've done recently!
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
after searching forever i FINALLY found a nether fortess. this took me wayy too long to do and was definitely slowing down my progress (but i'm so scared of dying far from home in the nether). inside the fortress, i set myself up at a blaze spawner and stayed there for a while. i fought enough blazes to end up with around 30 blaze rods, so i could make sure i wouldn't need to come back here for a long time:3
</p>

<p class="show-intro">
once i left the fortress, i returned home and crafted my eyes of ender. following them the first time took me to a stronghold with no portal room (which i think happens often on education edition?), so i built a nether portal and travelled a long way. this time i was able to find an end portal!

</p>

my fight with the dragon was wayy easier than i remembered last time being. this time i didn't forget to make slow falling potions which saved me a few times! highly recommend doing this<3

<p class="show-intro">
i killed the dragon while it was perching, without struggling very much?? i wonder if it is more difficult on java (which i was playing last time). instead of going home through the portal, i used an end gateway to set off in search for end cities.
</p>

<p class="show-intro">
within a few hundred blocks after coming out the other side of the gateway, i found 3 end cities next to each other, ALL with ships! i lost track of where i had and hadn't already cleared, so i don't think i killed 100% of the shulkers? but anyways
</p>

<p class="show-intro">
i got THREE pairs of elytra, then flew all the way back to the portal to the overworld, and back from the stronghold (where i set my spawn) to my house. it was nice to be home:) 
</p>

<p class="show-intro">
who knows what lies ahead for my minecraft world... i am hoping i get inspired and do not lose interest now? if you have any ideas pleaseee let me know thanks everyonee<3
