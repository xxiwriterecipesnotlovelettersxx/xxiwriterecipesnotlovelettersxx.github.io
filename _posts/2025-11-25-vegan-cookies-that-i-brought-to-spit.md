title: "vegan cookies that i brought to spit"
---

these struck a chord with the skramz youth at the foh/body shirt/cbs show...

### Ingredients
- olive oil
- 170g vegan butter (i used olive nuttelex but anything would work and probably be easier to measure)
- 2tbsp ground flaxseed
- 70ml warm water
- ~170g dark chocolate (i used whittaker's dark ghana)
- 2 cups plain flour
- 1/2tsp salt
- 3/4tsp bicarb soda
- 3/4 cup dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons cane sugar
- 1tbsp vanilla extract
- flaky sea salt also

### Instructions
1. add the sliced butter to a stainless steel skillet or saucepan. turn to medium heat. swirl the pan or stir occasionally until melted, foamy, and at a bubble (it should take 2:30 to 3 minutes)
2. heat for 2 to 3 more minutes, stirring frequently until nutty in aroma and slightly darker. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into a medium heatproof bowl to stop cooking. refrigerate for 25 minutes or until no longer warm.
3. in a small bowl or perhaps measuring jug, add the flaxseed meal to the warm water. whisk well to combine and rest for 7 minutes, whisk again, wait 8 minutes and finally whisk again
4. while waiting for the butter and flax egg, coarsely chop the chocolate and set aside. save 12 pieces of chopped chocolate to press into each cookie
5. in a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda until well incorporated.
6. once flax eggs have gelled and brown butter has cooled, add both to a different large bowl. add the brown sugar, cane sugar, and vanilla. use a whisk and whisk these together for ~45 seconds, until combined.
7. use a silicone spatula to add half of the dry ingredients into the wet. fold until just combined. add the rest of the dry ingredients and chopped chocolate. fold only until no dry spots remain.
8. scoop out cookie dough rounds using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, leveling off the top. scoop cookie dough balls onto a lined pan/baking tray. press a piece of cut chocolate into the top of each cookie.
9. once all of the dough is scooped into shape on the tray, generously sprinkle flaky sea salt over the top of each cookie. follow this with a light coat of sugar sprinkled in a similar fashion.
10. refrigerate the pan for 24 hours (sorry), or up to 72 hours.
11. when ready to bake, preheat your oven to 175ºC and arrange a rack in the center. add the cookie dough rounds, and space them out somewhat.
12. bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until edges are golden brown. remove from the oven to cool in their tray/s for 5-10 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack until chocolate has set.
