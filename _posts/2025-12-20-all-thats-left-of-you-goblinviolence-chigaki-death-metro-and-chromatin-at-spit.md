After spending a rather late lunch at the beautiful (and very conveniently placed) Huong Viet Vegan restaurant in Footscray, my friends and I made our way over to Spit just as the doors were starting to fill out. Chromatin filled the venue and surrounding street with a taste of what was to come as they completed their soundcheck for their second show.

Opening the day were Clean Coil, an indie surf/folk trio from Euroa on Taungurung land. Their set immediately charmed, relying on tight melodies and an uplifting, feel-good sound that suited the early afternoon perfectly. Not a minute in, a snapped guitar string halted the performance, but Asher from could be stars offered his guitar mid-set in an act of generosity. The band’s easy on-stage banter and clear chemistry kept spirits high, making this incident feel like part of the fun. Clean Coil’s set felt relaxed, genuine, and joyful, the perfect opener to settle everyone into the room.

This show carried an extra significance for could be stars, marking their last performance for the foreseeable future, and guitarist Sam Walker’s final show with the band. That sense of finality came to a head at the end of the set when Asher charged into Sam while playing, knocking him backwards. Ending the show, the band dropped their instruments and walked offstage. It was chaotic, affectionate, and very clearly symbolic of the end of a long-lasting era. The end of could be stars' set was met with loud applause and a lingering bittersweet energy.

Closing the afternoon were Street Carp, a slacker/alternative band from north-east Victoria. With their usual vocalist missing, the guitarist stepped up to the role of frontman for this show, a change that gave their performance a rough-around-the-edges charm. The band's crowd interaction and plenty of stage banter kept things loose. A Silverchair cover sparked recognition and enthusiasm, and eventually a small mosh started close to the stage. Their show felt communal and unpretentious, thriving on Street Carp's energy and plenty of additional distortion.
<br><br>
The show wrapped up around 4pm, leaving plenty of daylight outside. It was an afternoon that celebrated regional bands, DIY spirit and genuine connection. In the case of Could Be Stars, it also offered a heartfelt send-off. In my case, it also offered adequate time to catch a train to Footscray and catch an evening gig at Spit.
