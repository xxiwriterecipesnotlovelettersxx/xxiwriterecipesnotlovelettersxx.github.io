After spending a rather late lunch at the beautiful (and very conveniently placed) Huong Viet Vegan restaurant in Footscray, my friends and I made our way over to Spit just as the doors were starting to fill out. South-east Melbourne (Bunurong Country) band Chromatin filled the venue and surrounding street with a taste of what was to come as they completed their soundcheck for their second show.

Though Chromatin set the bar high with an incredible first performance at their Geelong house show back in October, they managed to raise it once more at Spit. Their blend of post hardcore and screamo was heavier than ever before, with ebbing and flowing guitar-driven melodies supporting vocalist Liam's raw, powerful screams.

As an unexpected, genre-bending cover, Chromatin made the song 'Snow' by could be stars their own, reimagining it as a sludgy and dark piece. During this tribute, the green alien toy from the August 3rd Underthealmonds house show made a reappearance, this time without finding any roofs to get stuck on.

After a break between bands, it was time for Chigaki Death Metro, an emoviolence band from Adelaide/Kaurna, to play. Their set was much anticipated thanks to their newest release, <a href="https://chigakideathmetro.bandcamp.com/album/10-songs">10 Songs</a>, coming out just the day before. Their live performance reflected the sassy and violent sound of the record, which a number of people who talked to me compared to the likes of The Great Redneck Hope.
