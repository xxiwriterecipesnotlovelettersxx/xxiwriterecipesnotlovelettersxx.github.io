After spending a rather late lunch at the beautiful (and very conveniently placed) Huong Viet Vegan restaurant in Footscray, my friends and I made our way over to Spit just as the doors were starting to fill out. South-east Melbourne (Bunurong Country) band Chromatin filled the venue and surrounding street with a taste of what was to come as they completed the soundcheck for their second show.

Though Chromatin set the bar high with an incredible first performance at their Geelong house show back in October, they managed to raise it once more at Spit. Their blend of post hardcore and screamo was heavier than ever before, with ebbing and flowing guitar-driven melodies supporting vocalist Liam's raw, powerful screams.
<br><br>
As an unexpected, genre-bending cover, Chromatin made the song 'Snow' by could be stars their own, reimagining it as a sludgy and dark piece. During this tribute, the green alien toy from the August 3rd Underthealmonds house show made a reappearance, this time without finding any roofs to get stuck on.

After a break between bands, it was time for Chigaki Death Metro, an emoviolence band from Adelaide/Kaurna, to play. Their set was much anticipated thanks to their newest release, <a href="https://chigakideathmetro.bandcamp.com/album/10-songs">10 Songs</a>, coming out just the day before. Their live performance reflected the record's sassy and violent sound, which many compared to The Great Redneck Hope.

Late into their set, Chigaki Death Metro promised a cover of Orchid's 'New Jersey vs. Valhalla', with the vocalist adding, "I expect to see you moving". The crowd didn't disappoint as the room descended into chaos.

Goblinviolence took over the stage next, returning to Spit to deliver their unique blend of sasscore and mathgrind once again. Living up to their name, their set could only be described as chaotic. Dissonant guitars and uncountable tempos, combined with high-pitched screams, encouraged perhaps the most unpredicatable and violent mosh of the night.
<br><br>
Regretfully, I missed the later section of their set escorting some friends to the station safely. I can only await Goblinviolence's return to play in Naarm again...

Naarm/Melbourne band all that's left of you played the final set of the night, their last performance before they "hit da studio" (huge). Guitarist Valentine's amp was screamingly loud, bringing a passionate and energetic close to the show. Rumours of a gatecrash cover were confirmed later in their set, as they brought flood, the title track from our first release, back to life. This was an emotional moment for some as they sung along.
<br><br>
Their raw and emotional screamo inspired some stage diving among the audience, and even saw Paddy from Wrench crowdsurfing. It was the perfect end to a late show, and everyone left Spit elatedly. Goblinviolence, seemingly not ready to say goodbye to Footscray, were seen walking through the area three separate times over the next hour and a half following the show's end.
