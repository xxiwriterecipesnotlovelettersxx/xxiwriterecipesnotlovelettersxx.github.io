### Ingredients
- oil
- 225g firm tofu PRESSED and crumbled
- 1 onion diced
- 1/2 tomato diced
- turmeric
- garlic powder
- nutritional yeast flakes
- salt
- pepper

### Instructions
1. in an oiled pan, over a medium heat, add onion and tomato. add the crumbled tofu shortly after.
2. allow to cook for perhaps 5 minutes
3. add a fair amount of turmeric, garlic powder, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper. i never ever measure these just do what feels right.
4. let it cook for... some time, ensuring you are stirring the pan consistently.
5. wait until the scramble has been steaming for a few minutes. usually it is ready then BUT does it really matter...
6. this is really nice atop TOASTED BREAD and sometimes with sriracha. add extra pepper on top after finished cooking.
