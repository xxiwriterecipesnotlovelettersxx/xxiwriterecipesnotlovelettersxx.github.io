Sunday afternoon to evening, The Tote hosted a sold-out festival of acts ranging from singer/songwriter to post-hardcore & metalcore, all playing to raise funds for an important cause.

I arrived at the location around around 3:00, 
<br><br>
I might discuss the drain's conditions etc

There was also this AWESOME and rather large freshwater yabby that we saw crawling upstream, out of the drain.

Generator solved, chromatin plays
<br><br>
I experienced Chromatin's set very differently to any way that I had before. Looking back, I think I was misinterpreting the reverberation and acoustics of loud music inside the storm drain, but at the time, their songs sounded like overproduced metal (with choir and obnoxious synths) to me. I tried my best to hear them for how they really played, and when I took out my earplugs I was able to experience their actual aggressive, rhythmic, and full sound.

Just as Keratin began setting up their equipment, my friends told me it was time for us to leave. While I was guided down the tunnel, I could hear their post-hardcore screamo echoing off the drain walls. Walking at the front, I felt like Orpheus, permitted to lead my lover out of the Underworld but forbidden to turn around and make sure she was following.
<br><br>
Although I missed their set, videos taken after we left showed a great skramz performance, high in emotion and energy.

I want to say a huge thank you to Laura for organising and running this show, and persevering through problems with the generator. This was such a fun afternoon/evening, and we owe it to them. Thanks to everyone who came to show their support or donated to the show fund (I will link it here if I find it!), and to my friends for their patience helping me make it home. ESPECIALLY guiding me through public transport. yikes
