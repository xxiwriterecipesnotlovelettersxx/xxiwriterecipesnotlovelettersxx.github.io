On Sunday, The Tote hosted a sold-out festival that ran from afternoon into evening, uniting nine different acts to support an important cause. Organised by Declan of @capital.noise and my friend Lotti, all proceeds from this show went towards <a href="https://jss.org.au/">Jesuit Social Services</a>, an Australian not-for-profit organisation who (among other things) provide support to people and families impacted by suicide. Through counselling, peer support groups, and community programs, their work focuses not only on prevention but also caring for those navigating grief and trauma in its aftermath.

<br>
Suicide, and mental health more broadly, remains an issue that we can't afford to ignore. Most people have been affected by suicide throughout their lives, whether directly or through someone they love. Thank you to everyone who donated, played, organised, or simply came along to support this show. Always remember that your actions carry meaning, and could be the difference that saves a life.

Singer/songwriter Zara Alice was the first act of this festival dreamy enchantuing, emotional acoustic

Following Zara Alice's opening performance were Street Carp, a band from regional Victoria who played an energetic and upbeat .......the chats cover, technical guitar playing, drums

After this, Djilang screamo band Wrench delivered what was by far their most intense and forceful performance yet. Paddy's dissonant and distorted guitar tones bordered on harsh noise at points, creating an abrasive wall of sound and oscillating feedback. Their set opened with a spoken word section, read by Jovi (Paddy's girlfriend), but quickly devolved into intense and emotional chaos. Early into their set, I was invited on stage to fulfill my promise of covering 'flood' by gatecrash on-stage with the band. During this, Paddy dove into the crowd and was swinging off a beam on the roof at one point??
<br><br>
A reflection of Wrench's fervent act, Paddy cut his hand while playing, spilling blood onto the pickguard of his guitar. Despite this he continued playing, and gratefully accepted help from somebody with a first-aid kit after their set. Paddy's screaming was also one of the highlights of their performance as he briefly introduced guttural low vocals.

Thanks so much to everyone who was involved in organising, hosting, playing, and coming to support this show and the cause that it represented. Music scenes like this one can build a shared community, and offer a place of support to those in need. Everybody's contributions matter so much!
