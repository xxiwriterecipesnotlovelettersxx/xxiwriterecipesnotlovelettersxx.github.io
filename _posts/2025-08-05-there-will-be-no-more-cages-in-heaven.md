<br>
leaving me here! pick up the pieces can't put back to gether. what my parents parents have planned. 
<br><br>
the last. all that you left behind buried again back to Your grave? why did he do it I wonder I wonder
<br><br>
why carry this out ? it's over my mind please i'll never forget you. 
<br><br><br><br>


crying ! i think no I hope you're thinking of me too. secretly. 
<br><br>
i want you to hate me if it's all that you feel, i'll see you tomorrow but i know we won't talk about it 
<br><br>
we never talk. we never spoke
