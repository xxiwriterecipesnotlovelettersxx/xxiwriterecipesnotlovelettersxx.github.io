<p class="show-intro">
oats, or 'avena sativa', are one of the most nourishing and beneficial foods you can incorporate into your diet.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
unrefined oats (which make up the majority of commercially available oats) are a whole grain. this means they retain all three parts of the grain kernel: the bran, germ, and endosperm. each part of the grain contributes essential elements. the bran layer is rich in fibre and b vitamins, which support digestion and energy metabolism. the germ contains healthy oils and important nutrients, and the starchy endosperm provides sustained energy along with b vitamins, iron, and fibre.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
due to this structure, oats have a well-balanced nutritional composition. they supply complex carbohydrates that fuel the body steadily, as opposed to leading to drastic energy spikes and crashes.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
for a grain, oats are also a good source of plant-based protein. this makes them particularly beneficial to vegans (me!!) or vegetarians.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
oats also contain large amounts of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant compounds. this dense concentration of nutrients has led to them being often-described as one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
one of the most important components of oats is a soluble fibre called beta-glucan. this fibre plays a major role in many of oats’ health benefits. beta-glucan helps reduce blood glucose and insulin response after meals. by forming a thick gel in the digestive tract, it also slows the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream, which supports stable blood sugar levels.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
this same fibre contributes to the regulation of type 2 diabetes AND supports heart health by helping to lower cholesterol levels. even further, it promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, improving digestive health and supporting a healthy microbiome. fibre might be the best thing in the world.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
due to their high fibre content, oats are also extremely filling. this sense of fullness can naturally support weight management if this is a goal of yours.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
oats provide a source of non-heme iron, the form of iron found in plant foods. though this type of iron is less easily absorbed on its own, there is a simple way to change this...
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
pairing oats with orange juice can significantly improve iron absorption. orange juice is rich in vitamin c, which increases the bioavailability of non-heme iron when consumed at the same time. PLEASE try this, as it also tastes really nice. this combination of oats and juice changed my life, maybe it will change yours too? pleaseee??
