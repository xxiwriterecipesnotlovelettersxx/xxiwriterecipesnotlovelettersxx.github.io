i've been mining AND crafting as of late... bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

after searching forever i FINALLY found a nether fortess. this had taken me wayy too long and was definitely the biggest thing slowing down my progress (but i'm so scared of dying far from home in the nether).
</p>
<p class="show-intro">
after almost getting killed by some wither skeletons, i set myself up at a blaze spawner and stayed there for a while. i fought enough blazes to end up with around 30 blaze rods, so i could make sure i wouldn't need to come back here for a long time:3

and, to keep a promise i made at the last spit show, i also brought everyone some of my <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/11/25/vegan-cookies-that-i-brought-to-spit.html">cookies</a>. this batch that i baked might have been my best so far...

in the afternoon we sat outside, making the most of the daylight before eating. while everyone else sat by or swam in jesse's pool, sienna, kal and i decided to move the christmas tree onto the dinner table (MUCH easier said than done). after a few minor setbacks, we started adding some final touches to the room.

<p class="show-intro">
we were lighting candles, setting the table, and getting all of the food ready to serve. sienna arranged some vegan cheese & sriracha to look like little snowmen, with peppercorn buttons & eyes. we also made up a last-minute punch, made from tropical juice, ginger beer, and sprite, with pieces of mango and a strawberry.

with all of our decorating completed, the results spoke for themselves...

<p class="show-intro">
to complete the room's ambience, we played some quiet music, closed the curtains and dimmed the lights, and finally invited everyone upstairs to eat.

after we finished our skramzmas dinner, we went into the kitchen to decorate <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/30/jasmines-vegan-gingerbread.html">gingerbread that jasmine had baked</a>, complete with a turmeric and mango frosting that asher happily contributed.

<p class="show-intro">
once the sun had set, we spent more time playing music, swimming in the pool, and looking at wasp nests in jesse's board game collection. although the evening would eventually end up as early morning, our skramzmas dinner didn't ever feel rushed or overplanned. yay!
