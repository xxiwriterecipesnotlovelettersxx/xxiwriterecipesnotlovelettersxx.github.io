<p class="show-intro">
hi guys. i've been getting back into minecraft lately.. we will se how long this lasts. here is what i've done recently!
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
after searching forever i FINALLY found a nether fortess. this took me wayy too long to do and was definitely slowing down my progress (but i'm so scared of dying far from home in the nether).
</p>
<p class="show-intro">
after almost getting killed by some wither skeletons, i set myself up at a blaze spawner and stayed there for a while. i fought enough blazes to end up with around 30 blaze rods, so i could make sure i wouldn't need to come back here for a long time:3
</p>

<p class="show-intro">
once i left the fortress, i returned home and crafted my eyes of ender. following them the first time took me to a stronghold with no portal room (which i think happens often on education edition?), so i built a nether portal and travelled far away. this time i was able to find an end portal!
