after searching forever i FINALLY found a nether fortess. this had taken me wayy too long and was definitely the biggest thing slowing down my progress (but i'm so scared of dying far from home in the nether).
</p>
<p class="show-intro">
after almost getting killed by some wither skeletons, i set myself up at a blaze spawner and stayed there for a while. i fought enough blazes to end up with around 30 blaze rods, so i could make sure i wouldn't need to come back here for a long time:3

to complete the room's ambience, we played some quiet music, closed the curtains and dimmed the lights, and finally invited everyone upstairs to eat.

after we finished our skramzmas dinner, we went into the kitchen to decorate <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/30/jasmines-vegan-gingerbread.html">gingerbread that jasmine had baked</a>, complete with a turmeric and mango frosting that asher happily contributed.

<p class="show-intro">
once the sun had set, we spent more time playing music, swimming in the pool, and looking at wasp nests in jesse's board game collection. although the evening would eventually end up as early morning, our skramzmas dinner didn't ever feel rushed or overplanned. yay!
