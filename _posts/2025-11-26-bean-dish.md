i usually make this with black beans but. today i learned it goes well with kidney beans also!

### Ingredients
- olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 crushed cloves garlic

- white wine vinegar
- 400g can tomatoes
- 400g can black/kidney beans, drained
- salt
- ground black pepper
- dried oregano
- fresh parsley

### Instructions
1. oil a pan over a medium heat and add onion and garlic. stir consistently for 5 minutes. add a generous sprinkle of yr spices. i don't measure these but do what feels right in your heart.
2. stir everything to coat and add a splash of white wine vinegar. stir through again.
3. add in the contents of the can of tomatoes. stir again.
4. drain and add the black beans or kidnet beans, then reduce temperature to a simmer.
5. let this sit for 10 minutes at a low temperature. after this time has passed, add a small amount of salt and a larger amount of pepper.. also add some dried oregano, and take off the heat.
6. before serving, stir through chopped fresh parsley.
