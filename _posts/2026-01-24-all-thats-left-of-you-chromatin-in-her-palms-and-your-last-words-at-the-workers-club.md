In the early afternoon of Saturday, January 24th, The Workers Club in Fitzroy held a show debuting two new bands from the Naarm emo scene, In Her Palms (which I am in!!) & your last words, playing alongside Chromatin and all that's left of you, two bands who have quickly become fixtures of the Australian skramz scene. This day was HOT (41 degrees) so it was very nice to have access to the air conditioned venue.

Playing their first live show, your last words were the first band of the afternoon. Their songwriting had a distinctive sound that blended slow, bright clean sections with hard-hitting and emotional screamo (remiscent of doris in their instrumentation). Despite a few difficulties with the kick pedal, their perseverance led to a solid performance that established a clear sound for their band going forward.
<br><br>
During their set, they covered I Hate Myself's 'To A Husband at War', a staple which saw members of the audience swaying and singing along. Very excited to see what these guys do next!

After a short break, my friends and I got on stage to play our first show as In Her Palms, a band sharing the same lineup as Could Be Stars. Our set featured a mix of newly-written songs and material carried over from gatecrash and Could Be Stars.
<br>
<br>
I was nervous at the start, but as we kept playing the tension eased and I found my footing. yay!

Following our set were Chromatin, delivering their same emotionally-charged and violent screamo.
<br><br>
As a reflection of the intensity of their set, Liam was rarely seen without his coconut water between songs. Chromatin also upheld their consistent tradition by playing a heavy, aggressive cover of 'Snow' by Could be Stars. Their set eventually finished, letting the high energy in the room slowly dissipate.

Headlining the night, it was time to play my first ever show as a member of Could be Stars. I was nervous to be on stage but settled in quickly. We played some songs from the usual setlist, but also added covers of two songs (flood & nothing to show) from Asher's and my old screamo band, gatecrash. While playing flood, I looked out into the audience and saw Liam from Chromatin at eye-level with me, crowdsurfing. Paddy from Wrench was quick to follow suit.
<br>
<br>
We also made the last-minute decision to debut Floodlight, a song from our new project In Her Palms. This was fun to play (but clearly not well rehearsed yet). For Could be Stars' mostly calm sound, the crowd were very energetic - almost rivalling Chromatin's set with the amount of moshing at times. As we played our final song, Snow, I saw Liam go upside down in the crowd, before crashing down on my power supply and cutting my guitar signal.

This show was so much fun!! Thank you to all of the wonderful bands that I played with, and to my lovely Could be Stars bandmates for helping me make it this far <3
