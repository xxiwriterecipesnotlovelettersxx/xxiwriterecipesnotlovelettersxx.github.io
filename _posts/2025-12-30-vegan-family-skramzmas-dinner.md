dude fuck my fucking chungus life how do i write this introduction.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
here is how YOU can host your very own skramzmas dinner!
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
to cater for the night, i prepared a main course of <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/27/skramzmas-stuffed-pumpkin-roast.html">roasted butternut pumpkin</a>, which was filled with stuffing made from mushroom, lentils, cranberries, nutmeg, and more.

<p class="show-intro">
for dessert, i tried my hand at making a <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/30/tiramisu.html">vegan tiramisu</a>. although i slightly misjudged the size of container i would need, it exceeded my expectations a lot! i will definitely make this again in the future.

and, to fulfill a promise made at the last spit show, i also brought everyone some of my <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/11/25/vegan-cookies-that-i-brought-to-spit.html">cookies</a>. these were popular last time, and this batch that i made for the skramzmas dinner might have been the best i have baked so far?? if i do say so myself

in the afternoon we sat outside while the pumpkin cooked in the oven, making the most of the sunlight before we ate. while everyone sat near or swam in jesse's pool, sienna, kal and i tasked ourselves with moving the christmas tree onto the dinner table (which was MUCH easier said than done). after a few minor setbacks, we took to finalising the decorations and adding some finishing touches to the space.

<p class="show-intro">
we were busily lighting candles, setting the table, and ensuring all of the food was ready to serve. sienna arranged some vegan cheese & sriracha in the shape of some snowmen, with peppercorn eyes. we also made a last minute tropical punch, made of tropical juice, ginger beer, and sprite, filled with pieces of mango and one strawberry.

Their raw and emotional screamo inspired some stage diving among the audience, and even saw Paddy from Wrench crowdsurfing. It was the perfect end to a late show, and everyone left Spit elatedly. Goblinviolence, seemingly not ready to say goodbye to Footscray, were seen walking through the area three separate times over the next hour and a half following the show's end.
