<p class="show-intro">
dude fuck my fucking chungus life how do i write this introduction.
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
here is how YOU can host your very own skramzmas dinner!
</p>
<br>
<p class="show-intro">
to cater for the night, i prepared a main course of <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/27/skramzmas-stuffed-pumpkin-roast.html">roasted butternut pumpkin</a>, which was filled with stuffing made from mushroom, lentils, crannberries, nutmeg, and more.

<p class="show-intro">
for dessert, i tried hand at making a <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/12/30/tiramisu.html">vegan tiramisu</a>. although i slightly misjudged the size of container i would need, it exceeded my expectations a lot! i will definitely make this again in the future.

<p class="show-intro">
and, to fulfill a promise made at the last spit show, i also brought everyone some of my <a href="https://xxiwriterecipesnotlovelettersxx.github.io/recipe/2025/11/25/vegan-cookies-that-i-brought-to-spit.html">cookies</a>. these were much loved last time i made them, and this batch that i made for the skramzmas dinner might have been the best i have made so far??

Regretfully, I missed the later section of their set escorting some friends to the station safely. I can only await Goblinviolence's return to play in Naarm again...

Naarm/Melbourne band all that's left of you played the final set of the night, their last performance before they "hit da studio" (huge). Guitarist Valentine's amp was screamingly loud, bringing a passionate and energetic close to the show. Rumours of a gatecrash cover were confirmed later in their set, as they brought 'flood', the title track from our first release, back to life. This was an emotional moment for some as they sung along.
<br><br>
Their raw and emotional screamo inspired some stage diving among the audience, and even saw Paddy from Wrench crowdsurfing. It was the perfect end to a late show, and everyone left Spit elatedly. Goblinviolence, seemingly not ready to say goodbye to Footscray, were seen walking through the area three separate times over the next hour and a half following the show's end.
